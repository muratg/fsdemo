F# + SQL Demo
=============

A simple project that I used to demo F# basics + SQL Type Providers to my team.

### CSharpProject/FSharpProject

These are "identical" programs, and are meant to show a few lines of F# code to a C# dev who has no familiarity with F#.

### FSharpIntro.fsx

This file shows some of the select F# features that I use in the type provider demos.

### SQLDemo*.fsx

These are the simple demos that I showed to the folks in my team.
